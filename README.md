# Thecore Scripts
These are some helper scripts to make developing using [Thecore](https://github.com/gabrieletassoni/thecore) even easier.
 * new\_thecore\_app.rb is used as a template file for [rails new](https://github.com/gabrieletassoni/thecore/wiki/Create-a-Thecore-based-RoR-app)
 * new\_thecore\_plugin.rb is used as a template file for [rails plugin new](https://github.com/gabrieletassoni/thecore/wiki/Create-a-new-Component-for-Thecore)
 * manage\_projects\_working\_dir.thor is used to setup the engine or app directory to be used by git.
## TO DO
 * Move the thecorize task from thecore engine to a thor script thus it can be run inside an engine. (thor in itself doesn't need to load a rails app to run)
 * Find a way to run thecorize thor script from the internet or install it into the system to have it available for use on development computers.
